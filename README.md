Download
--------

See the [Releases](https://github.com/mmatyas/openblok/releases) page to download the latest version.

On Debian/*buntu, you can also install the game from a PPA:

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository https://dl.bintray.com/mmatyas/deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openblok
```


Dependencies
------------

- CMake (at least 3.1)
- C++11 supporting compiler (GCC 4.9 or better)
- SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_ttf
- optional: gcov, lcov (for generating test coverage report)

Eg. on Debian: `sudo apt install cmake libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev`

or on Fedora/RPM: `sudo dnf install cmake SDL2-devel SDL2_image-devel SDL2_mixer-devel SDL2_ttf-devel`


Build
-----

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./src/openblok --data ../data
```

**Optional build parameters:**

- `ENABLE_MP3`, `ENABLE_MOD`, `ENABLE_FLAC`: Enable/disable loading certain media formats. By default, all of them are `ON`.
- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`: To create an **optimized release build**, set this to `Release`. To create a **debug build**, set this value to `Debug`. See the CMake documentation. Default: `Release`.
- `INSTALL_PORTABLE`: The game needs to know where it can find the data files. By default, the game is searching for them in the absolute path of the installation location, which is usually `/usr/local/share/openblok` or `C:\Program Files\openblok`. By setting `INSTALL_PORTABLE` to `ON`, the game will search for the files in the same directory as the binary. Default: `OFF` on Linux, `ON` on Windows.
- `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`: The base directory of the installation step (eg. `make install`). Defaults to `/usr/local` or `C:\Program Files`. See the CMake documentation.
- `BUILD_TESTS`: Builds the test suite. You can run them by calling `./build/tests/openblok_test`. Debug build only, default: `ON`.
- `BUILD_COVERAGE`: Allows building the test coverage report. Requires `BUILD_TESTS` and `gcov`/`lcov`. Default: `OFF`.

**Useful build targets**

- `make coverage`: Builds the test coverage report
- `make install/strip`: Installs the game on your system
- `make package`: Creates `tar.gz` and Debian `deb` packages


Notes
-----

**Runtime arguments**

You can change certain game parameters, eg. the location of the data directory. Run the game with the `--help` flag to see the available options.

**Hardware acceleration on ARM Linux**

Using the default SDL2 library shipped with Debian/Raspian, hardware acceleration may not work properly, causing slowness and ugly graphics. For the best performance, it is recommended to build your own SDL2, as described [here](https://github.com/mmatyas/openblok/wiki/Custom-SDL2-build-for-ARM). With hardware acceleration, OpenBlok runs full speed even on a first-gen Raspberry Pi.
